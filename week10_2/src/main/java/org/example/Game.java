/*
 * CHANGES & VIOLATIONS FIXED:
 * - Method `StartGame()` â†’ `startGame()` (MethodName).
 * - Added full Javadoc on class and methods (JavadocType, JavadocMethod).
 * - EmptyLineSeparator added before methods.
 * - Braces added to all control structures (NeedBraces).
 * - Replaced local `gameOver` with call to `isGameOver()` for better abstraction.
 * - Used consistent naming and spacing (Indentation, WhitespaceAround).
